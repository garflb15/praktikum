Description

Currently OIL can deal with fixed target-urls configured in OIL.provisioning_interfaces table only. The part after the interface key is simple ignored by the ProxyController. E.g. oil.ondaily-trunk12c.infonova.at:8087/oil/proxy/IAP_PROVISIONING/myApiPath: /myApiPath here will not be send to the target system and is ignored.

The goal of this US is that the API path part will not be ignored for sync interfaces and send to the target system. Additionally the API path and request + response should be visible in the OIL UI.
